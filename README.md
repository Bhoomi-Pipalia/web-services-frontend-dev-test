# Assessment


## Part 1

The first step of the assignment is to fetch data from this public JSON API, and present the information on the screen. The route to fetch the data is:

https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/akabab/superhero-api@0.3.0/api/all.json


You do not need any credentials to access the URL above. The goal of this part is to present the data as a list on the screen like below:

<img src='./images/01.png'/>

Do not worry about formatting for this part. Just present the correct information given the API above on the screen.

## Part 2

The second step of the assignment is to style the data in the previous part using CSS. Replicate the style of the image below as best as you can.

<img src='./images/02.png'/>

***Note: The card list should scroll vertically.***

If you are having difficulties replicating this part exactly and it is taking too long, move onto the next part. The future steps do not measure your ability to write CSS and HTML.


## Part 3
In this part, you are going to add a text input, where a user can filter the list of heroes by their name as you can see on the images below.

<img src='./images/03.png'/>
<img src='./images/04.png'/>


## Part 4

In this part, you are going to make each hero have an expandable list view, so that you can view all of their powers stats. See the images below for what the view should look like when expanded. 

<img src='./images/05.png'/>
<img src='./images/06.png'/>


## Part 5
In this part, you will add a text field in the expanded view of each hero to add tags about the hero. Here is what it looks like (added a tag called “love”):

<img src='./images/07.png'/>


## Part 6
**In this last part**, you will add a tag bar to filter hero based on tags. Do not be concerned with filtering both by name and tags at the same time. 

The Image bellow shows only the Super Heroes with the tag ***"love"***
<img src='./images/08.png'/>


The Image bellow shows only the Super Heroes with the tag ***"hate"***
